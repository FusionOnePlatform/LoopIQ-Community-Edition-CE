## Why We Built This

The modern SDLC is broken across dozens of tools.  
LoopIQ CE brings the core workflow modules into a **unified, modern, open platform** — giving teams full control and flexibility **without enterprise lock-in**.

If you're tired of:

- Jira plugin chaos  
- fragmented SDLC workflows  
- closed ITSM ecosystems  
- expensive TestRail/Xray/Tempo addons  
- GitLab’s limited PM/Test features  
- ServiceNow’s heavy complexity  

Then **LoopIQ Community Edition** is for you.
